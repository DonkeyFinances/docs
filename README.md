## Overview

The DonkeyFinances protocol is a robust peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging cryptocurrencies [(SRC-20 Native Assets)](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-20-native-asset/) on the [Fuel Network](https://fuel.network/) blockchain. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

### How does DonkeyFinances compare to other blockchains?

Fuel is an operating system purpose-built for Ethereum rollups, designed to help developers build decentralized economies at scale.

FuelVM leverages advancements proposed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) but not implemented due to backward compatibility constraints. These improvements include parallel transaction execution and support for multiple native assets.

FuelVM achieves superior processing capacity by executing transactions in parallel, utilizing strict state access lists with a UTXO model. By identifying transaction dependencies beforehand, Fuel full nodes can engage multiple CPU threads and cores, enhancing compute power, state access, and transactional throughput compared to single-threaded blockchains.
