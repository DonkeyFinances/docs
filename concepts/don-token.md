# DON Token

The DON token is the native asset within the Donkeyswap ecosystem, serving multiple purposes that drive participation and governance. DON tokens are used to reward liquidity providers, pay for transaction fees, and participate in the governance of the platform. Holders of DON tokens have a say in key decisions, including changes to the protocol, the addition of new liquidity pools, and the allocation of rewards.

One of the unique features of Donkeyswap is its yield farming strategies. By staking DONLP tokens in Donkeyswap Vaults, users can earn additional DON rewards on top of the swap fees they already receive. This incentive structure encourages active participation in the ecosystem, ensuring that liquidity remains robust and the platform continues to grow.
