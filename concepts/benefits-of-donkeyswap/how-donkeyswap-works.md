# ðŸ’¡ How Donkeyswap works

**Concepts are similar to EVM DEXs**

Donkeyswap is an automated market maker (AMM) that combines the Ve (3,3) tokenomics model, integrating Olympus DAOâ€™s game theory with Curve Financeâ€™s vote escrow system. This approach addresses common decentralized exchange (DEX) issues like token dilution and mercenary capital by incentivizing token holders to lock their tokens. This ensures better liquidity allocation, rewards governance participation, and reduces selling pressure, ultimately aiming to create a sustainable, efficient, and community-driven AMM with enhanced rewards for both liquidity providers and ve-token holders.

Operating on the Fuel blockchain, Donkeyswap uses a constant product formula for non-stable pairs ensuring decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. As a decentralized exchange (DEX), it facilitates direct asset trading without relying on a traditional order book. Users provide liquidity to the protocol, earning swap fees and receiving LP (DONLP) tokens as proof of their contribution. These tokens can be used to earn additional yield or redeemed for their initial deposit plus accrued fees. This continuous cycle of liquidity provision helps maintain substantial liquidity across all chains, ensuring minimal slippage and uninterrupted 24/7 trading.
