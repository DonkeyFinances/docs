#### Charts

LP tokens are issued when you deposit assets into a liquidity pool. They represent your share of the pool and can be redeemed for a portion of the pool's funds and any accrued fees. The value of LP tokens depends on the prices of the assets within the pool.

In the **Chart** tab, youâ€™ll find a graphical representation of the LP token price relative to another asset, such as USDT. You can:

* **Expand/Minimize**: Adjust the size of the chart.
* **Refresh**: Update the chart with the latest data.
* **Adjust Timeframe**: Change the time period displayed on the chart.

These features help you track and analyze the performance of your LP tokens.

#### Pool Activity

In addition to price charts, the UI offers a detailed view of swaps and liquidity actions under the **Pool Activity** tab.

* **Swaps Tab**: This section displays recent token swaps, including the tokens involved and the time of each transaction. It shows how many hours or minutes ago the swap occurred. You can click on a specific swap to view the transaction details on Etherscan.
