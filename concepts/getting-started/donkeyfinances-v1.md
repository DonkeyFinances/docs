# DonkeyFinances V1

**Understanding DonkeyFinances (v1)**

Getting started with DonkeyFinances can feel overwhelming due to its unique interface and concepts. This guide is designed to help those familiar with DeFi and crypto better understand DonkeyFinances, how it works, and how it generates income for liquidity providers (LPs).

#### What is Donkey.fi?

At its core, Donkey.fi functions as a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users and protocols to swap ERC-20 tokens (e.g., DAI to USDC) with minimal fees and low slippage. Unlike traditional exchanges that rely on matching buyers and sellers, DonkeyFinances uses liquidity pools. These pools need a high volume of liquidity to operate effectively, and in return for providing this liquidity, LPs receive rewards.

DonkeyFinances is a non-custodial platform, meaning its developers cannot access users' tokens. Additionally, DonkeyFinances pools are non-upgradable, ensuring the security and stability of the contracts that protect user funds.

#### What are Liquidity Pools?

Liquidity pools are collections of tokens held in smart contracts, allowing for token swaps and withdrawals at predetermined rates. By adding liquidity to these pools, users can earn trading fees and other rewards. For more details, check out the **Understanding DonkeyFinances Pools** section.

#### What do the Percentages Next to Each Pool Mean?

On the DonkeyFinances UI, you’ll notice various percentages next to the pools:

* **Reward Gauges**: These show the bonus DON emissions that liquidity providers are eligible for. More details can be found in the **Reward Gauges** section.

#### What is the DON Token?

DON is DonkeyFinances' native governance and utility token, used for voting in governance decisions and earning rewards.

#### Can I Use DonkeyFinances on Sidechains?

Yes, DonkeyFinances has expanded to several sidechains, and this growth will continue. Check out our **Multichain** section for more details.

#### How Can I Launch a Pool?

DonkeyFinances' allows for the permissionless deployment of pools via the DonkeyFinances' Factory, meaning anyone can launch a pool. For a comprehensive guide, visit the **Factory Pools** section.

#### Why has DonkeyFinances Grown So Quickly?

&#x20;DonkeyFinances' rapid growth stemmed from its dominance in the stablecoin market. With the rise of stablecoins (like DAI, USDC, sUSD, etc.), there’s a high demand for swapping between them. Centralized exchanges often charge high fees, making  Donkeyswap the best option for stablecoin exchanges due to its low fees and minimal slippage.

Recently, DonkeyFinances introduced **v2 Crypto Pools**, extending its efficient model to volatile assets like BTC and ETH.
