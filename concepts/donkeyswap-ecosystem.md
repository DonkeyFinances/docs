# DonkeyFinances Ecosystem

The DonkeyFinances ecosystem is designed to create a comprehensive DeFi platform that maximizes returns for users while ensuring liquidity across all chains. Key components of the ecosystem include:

• Liquidity Pools: These pools allow users to deposit tokens and earn a share of the fees generated from trades. The constant product formula ensures that liquidity is always available, minimizing slippage and improving the trading experience.

• Governance: DonkeyFinances is governed by DON token holders, who can propose and vote on changes to the protocol. This decentralized governance model ensures that the platform evolves in line with the needs and desires of the community.

• Yield Farming: Users can stake their DONLP tokens in DonkeyFinances Vaults to earn additional DON rewards. These yield farming strategies are designed to maximize returns for LPs while maintaining liquidity across the platform.
