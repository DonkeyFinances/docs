# 🫏 What is Donkeyswap?

**Donkeyswap** is an innovative automated market maker (AMM) built on the Fuel blockchain, integrating advanced tokenomics and decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanics. By utilizing the **Ve (3,3) tokenomics model**, which merges **Olympus DAO’s game theory** with **Curve Finance’s vote escrow system**, Donkeyswap addresses major challenges in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like token dilution and mercenary capital. This model encourages users to lock their tokens, promoting better liquidity allocation, more active governance participation, and reduced selling pressure.
