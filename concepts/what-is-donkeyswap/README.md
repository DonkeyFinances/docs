# ü´è DonkeySwap

DonkeySwap is an innovative automated market maker (AMM) built on the **Fuel blockchain**, integrating advanced tokenomics and decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanics. It utilizes the **ve(3,3) tokenomics model**, combining Olympus DAO‚Äôs game theory with Curve Finance‚Äôs vote escrow system to tackle common challenges in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as token dilution and mercenary capital.

* **Liquidity Provision and Rewards**

Users, known as Liquidity Providers (LPs), contribute assets to liquidity pools and earn a share of the swap fees generated from trades. They receive Donkey LP (DONLP) tokens, which act as a receipt for their contribution. These tokens can be used to earn additional yield or redeemed for the initial deposit plus any accrued fees, ensuring deep liquidity across supported blockchains and facilitating low-slippage trades.

* **Advanced Tokenomics with ve(3,3) System**

The ve(3,3) system encourages users to lock their tokens, improving liquidity allocation, governance participation, and reducing selling pressure. This model enhances the platform's overall liquidity and governance, addressing issues such as token dilution and mercenary capital.
