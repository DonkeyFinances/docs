# What is Donkeyswap?

Donkeyswap is an innovative automated market maker (AMM) that blends cutting-edge tokenomics with the latest advancements in decentralized finance (DeFi). By integrating the Ve (3,3) tokenomics model, which combines Olympus DAO’s game theory with Curve Finance’s vote escrow system, Donkeyswap tackles some of the key challenges facing decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as token dilution and mercenary capital. This unique approach incentivizes users to lock their tokens, leading to better liquidity allocation, more meaningful governance participation, and reduced selling pressure. The result is a sustainable, efficient, and community-driven AMM that offers enhanced rewards for both liquidity providers and ve-token holders.

Operating on the Fuel blockchain, Donkeyswap employs a constant product formula for non-stable pairs, ensuring decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. As a DEX, it facilitates direct asset trading without relying on a traditional order book, enabling seamless and efficient trades.
