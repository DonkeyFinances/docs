# CRV & veCRV

#### **What is the purpose and utility of CRV?**

CRV serves two main purposes within the Curve Finance ecosystem:

* **Incentivizing liquidity providers**: CRV rewards liquidity providers on Curve, ensuring low fees and minimal slippage.
* **Governance participation**: CRV holders can vote on protocol decisions, shaping the future of Curve Finance.

Additionally, CRV holders can lock their tokens as **veCRV** (vote-escrowed CRV), granting them time-weighted voting power in governance and a share of the fees generated by the platform.

***

#### **How can you acquire CRV?**

CRV can be obtained in two ways:

1. **Buying on exchanges**: CRV is available for purchase on various cryptocurrency exchanges.
2. **As a reward**: Liquidity providers earn CRV by participating in Curve’s pools or lending markets with CRV rewards.

This incentivizes liquidity provision and helps Curve maintain low fees and slippage.

***

#### **Where can I find the CRV release schedule?**

The release schedule for CRV over the next six years can be found on the main UI: (Curve Inflation Schedule.)

For detailed information on CRV emissions over the next 10 years, including a supply calculator, visit the **Supply & Distribution** section.

***

#### **What is the current circulating supply of CRV?**

You can check the current circulating supply in three ways:

1. On the main UI: (DonkeySwap Inflation.)
2. Using the supply calculator available in the resources section.
3. Via the on-chain contract:&#x20;

#### **When was CRV launched?**

CRV was officially launched on **(Date.)**

***

#### **What is CRV vote-locking?**

**Vote-locking** refers to locking your CRV tokens for a specified period to receive **veCRV**. The longer the lock, the more veCRV you receive. Vote-locking allows you to:

* Participate in governance voting.
* Boost your CRV rewards.
* Earn trading fees.

**Note**: veCRV is non-transferable. Once your lock period ends, you can reclaim your CRV tokens.

***

#### **What is the vote-locking boost?**

When you vote-lock CRV, you also earn a boost on your provided liquidity, up to **2.5x**. This boost incentivizes governance participation by offering users a larger share of daily CRV emissions.

Learn more about boosting here: (Boosting CRV Rewards.)

***

#### **When did the boost feature start?**

The boost feature was introduced on **(Date)**, at around 11 PM UTC.

***

#### **What are veCRV?**

**veCRV** (vote-escrowed CRV) represents your locked CRV. The longer you lock CRV (up to four years), the more voting power (veCRV) you gain. For example:

* **1,000 CRV locked for one year** equals **250 veCRV**.
* **CRV locked for four years** gives **1 veCRV per CRV**.

Your veCRV weight decreases as your locked tokens approach their expiry. More details can be found here: [Curve Locker](https://dao.curve.fi/locker).

***

#### **How is your boost calculated?**

Your boost depends on various factors, such as the amount of liquidity you provide and the total liquidity in the pool. For a deeper understanding of the boost formula, visit (Boost Calculation.)

***

#### **What if I provide liquidity in multiple pools?**

Your voting power applies to all pools but may result in different boosts depending on the liquidity in each pool.

***

#### **What happens if more people vote-lock CRV?**

If others vote-lock more CRV, your boost remains the same as when it was applied. However, if this leads to an imbalance, another user can "kick" you, updating your boost to its real value.

***

#### **How often does my boost adjust to changes in voting power?**

Your boost adjusts at specific checkpoints (e.g., withdrawing, depositing, or minting CRV). If your veCRV decreases over time, your boost remains based on the previous value until the next checkpoint.

***

#### **How can I apply my boost?**

After locking or adding to your CRV, click the **"Apply Boost"** button for each pool you're providing liquidity to. Your boost will also update when you deposit or withdraw from a pool.

***

#### **How do I know if my boost is active?**

If your boost is showing on the UI, it's active. If it doesn’t appear, you need to manually apply it.

***

#### **How does the yearly emissions reduction work?**

CRV emissions decrease yearly. Anyone can trigger the reduction after 365 days by calling the **update\_mining\_parameters** function on the CRV contract:&#x20;

Failure to trigger the function results in CRV continuing at the current emission rate until it's called. Each time this function is triggered, a new epoch begins, marking another 365-day countdown.

***

#### **How is CRV minted?**

CRV is minted when users stake in **gauges** allocated to mint CRV. Once minted, the tokens are added to the total supply and transferred to the user. If users delay minting, a discrepancy can arise between the theoretical and real supply of CRV tokens, as shown on block explorers.
