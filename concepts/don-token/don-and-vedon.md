# DON & veDON

#### **What is the purpose and utility of DON?**

DON serves two main purposes within the DonkeyFinances ecosystem:

* **Incentivizing liquidity providers**: DON rewards liquidity providers on DonkeyFinances, ensuring low fees and minimal slippage.
* **Governance participation**: DON holders can vote on protocol decisions, shaping the future of DonkeyFinances.

Additionally, DON holders can lock their tokens as **veDON** (vote-escrowed DON), granting them time-weighted voting power in governance and a share of the fees generated by the platform.

***

#### **How can you acquire DON?**

DON can be obtained in two ways:

1. **Buying on exchanges**: DON is available for purchase on various cryptocurrency exchanges.
2. **As a reward**: Liquidity providers earn DON by participating in DonkeyFinances pools or lending markets with DON rewards.

This incentivizes liquidity provision and helps DonkeyFinances maintain low fees and slippage.

***

#### **Where can I find the DON release schedule?**

The release schedule for DON over the next six years can be found on the main UI: (DonkeyFinances Inflation Schedule.)

For detailed information on DON emissions over the next 10 years, including a supply calculator, visit the **Supply & Distribution** section.

***

#### **What is the current circulating supply of DON ?**

You can check the current circulating supply in three ways:

1. On the main UI: (DonkeySwap Inflation.)
2. Using the supply calculator available in the resources section.
3. Via the on-chain contract:&#x20;

***

#### **When was DON launched?**

DON was officially launched on **(Date.)**

***

#### **What is DON vote-locking?**

**Vote-locking** refers to locking your DON tokens for a specified period to receive **veDON**. The longer the lock, the more veDON you receive. Vote-locking allows you to:

* Participate in governance voting.
* Boost your DON rewards.
* Earn trading fees.

**Note**: veDON is non-transferable. Once your lock period ends, you can reclaim your DON tokens.

***

#### **What is the vote-locking boost?**

When you vote-lock DON, you also earn a boost on your provided liquidity, up to **2.5x**. This boost incentivizes governance participation by offering users a larger share of daily DON emissions.

Learn more about boosting here: (Boosting DON Rewards.)

***

#### **When did the boost feature start?**

The boost feature was introduced on **(Date)**, at around 11 PM UTC.

***

#### **What are veDON?**

**veDON** (vote-escrowed DON) represents your locked DON. The longer you lock DON (up to four years), the more voting power (veDON) you gain. For example:

* **1,000 DON locked for one year** equals **250 veDON**.
* **DON locked for four years** gives **1 veDON per DON**.

Your veDON weight decreases as your locked tokens approach their expiry. More details can be found here: DonkeyFinances Locker.

***

#### **How is your boost calculated?**

Your boost depends on various factors, such as the amount of liquidity you provide and the total liquidity in the pool. For a deeper understanding of the boost formula, visit (Boost Calculation.)

***

#### **What if I provide liquidity in multiple pools?**

Your voting power applies to all pools but may result in different boosts depending on the liquidity in each pool.

***

#### **What happens if more people vote-lock DON?**

If others vote-lock more DON, your boost remains the same as when it was applied. However, if this leads to an imbalance, another user can "kick" you, updating your boost to its real value.

***

#### **How often does my boost adjust to changes in voting power?**

Your boost adjusts at specific checkpoints (e.g., withdrawing, depositing, or minting DON). If your veDON decreases over time, your boost remains based on the previous value until the next checkpoint.

***

#### **How can I apply my boost?**

After locking or adding to your DON, click the **"Apply Boost"** button for each pool you're providing liquidity to. Your boost will also update when you deposit or withdraw from a pool.

***

#### **How do I know if my boost is active?**

If your boost is showing on the UI, it's active. If it doesnâ€™t appear, you need to manually apply it.

***

#### **How does the yearly emissions reduction work?**

DON emissions decrease yearly. Anyone can trigger the reduction after 365 days by calling the **update\_mining\_parameters** function on the DON contract:&#x20;

Failure to trigger the function results in DON continuing at the current emission rate until it's called. Each time this function is triggered, a new epoch begins, marking another 365-day countdown.

***

#### **How is DON minted?**

DON is minted when users stake in **gauges** allocated to mint DON. Once minted, the tokens are added to the total supply and transferred to the user. If users delay minting, a discrepancy can arise between the theoretical and real supply of DON tokens, as shown on block explorers.
