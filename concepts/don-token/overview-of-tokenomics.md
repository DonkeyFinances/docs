The total supply of **3.03 billion CRV** is allocated as follows:

At launch, the initial supply was approximately **1.3 billion CRV** (about 43% of the total), distributed as:

* **5%** to pre-CRV liquidity providers, with a 1-year vesting period
* **30%** to shareholders (team and investors), with a 2-4 year vesting period
* **3%** to employees, with a 2-year vesting period
* **5%** to the community reserve

The **circulating supply** at launch was zero, and the initial release rate was around **2 million CRV per day**.

CRV inflation, driven by community emissions for providing liquidity, started at **274 million tokens per year** in (year). This emission rate decreases by roughly **16% each year**.

**Utility**

CRV has four primary use cases, many of which require locked CRV (veCRV):

1. **Incentivizing Liquidity Providers**: CRV rewards are distributed to liquidity providers to encourage liquidity provision in pools and lending markets.
2. **Boosting CRV Rewards**: Liquidity providers can increase their CRV rewards by up to **2.5x** by holding veCRV.
3. **Governance Participation**: Holding veCRV allows users to participate in governance, including voting on CRV emissions (gauge weight votes).
4. **Fee Collection**: Users holding veCRV can collect a portion of the fees generated from swaps and loans on Curve.

{% hint style="info" %}
**veCRV** stands for **vote-escrowed CRV**, which refers to CRV tokens locked for voting within the Curve DAO. Terms like **locked CRV**, **vote-locked CRV**, and **vote-escrowed CRV** are used interchangeably across the ecosystem to describe veCRV.
