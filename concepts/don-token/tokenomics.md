**Utility**

DON has four primary use cases, many of which require locked DON (veDON):

1. **Incentivizing Liquidity Providers**: DON rewards are distributed to liquidity providers to encourage liquidity provision in pools and lending markets.
2. **Boosting DON Rewards**: Liquidity providers can increase their DON rewards by up to **2.5x** by holding veDON.
3. **Governance Participation**: Holding veDON allows users to participate in governance, including voting on DON emissions (gauge weight votes).
4. **Fee Collection**: Users holding veDON can collect a portion of the fees generated from swaps and loans on DonkeyFinances.

{% hint style="info" %}
**veDON** stands for **vote-escrowed DON**, which refers to DON tokens locked for voting within the DonkeyFinances. Terms like **locked DON**, **vote-locked DON**, and **vote-escrowed DON** are used interchangeably across the ecosystem to describe veDON.
